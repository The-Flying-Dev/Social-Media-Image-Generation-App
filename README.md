Creating muscle memory of the basic process of development is a key practice towards becoming a better developer. 
So here I am having just completed a rails app following the guide [How to Build a Social Media Image Generation App Using Ruby on Rails](https://www.bannerbear.com/blog/how-to-build-a-social-media-image-generation-app-using-ruby-on-rails-and-the-bannerbear-api/#creating--saving-articles) on bannerbear.com.<br/>

* The experiment for building this app was to create multiple branches and merge it all back into the main.
